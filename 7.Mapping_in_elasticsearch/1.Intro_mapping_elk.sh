what is mapping in elasticsearch:

Mapping is the process of defining how a document and the fields it contains are stored and indexed.


Dynamic Mapping: Automatically detects the new fields and add them to the index mappings.
This is useful when dealing with the unstructured data.

Explicit Mapping: Provides detailed control over how each field in your document indexed and stored.
